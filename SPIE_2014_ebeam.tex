\begin{abstract}
Infrared spectrographs employing silicon immersion gratings can be significantly more compact than spectrographs using front-surface gratings.  The Si gratings also offer the possibility of continuous wavelength coverage at high spectral resolution.  The grooves in Si gratings are made with semiconductor lithography techniques, to date almost entirely using contact mask photolithography.  Planned near-infrared astronomical spectrographs can require either finer groove pitches or higher positional accuracy than can be achieved with standard UV contact mask photolithography.  A collaboration between the University of Texas at Austin Silicon Diffractive Optics Group and the NASA JPL Microdevices Lab has experimented with direct writing silicon immersion grating grooves with electron beam lithography.  The device production process involves depositing positive e-beam resist on 1 to 30 mm thick, 100 mm diameter monolithic crystalline silicon substrates.  The JEOL 9300FS e-beam writer uses a 50 nm step size with a typical spot size of 300 nm at about 60 nA of current and 100 keV power.  Our typical groove frequency for echelle grating prototypes is in the vicinity of 40 $-$ 12.5 grooves/mm (25-80 m groove spacing) but groove frequencies as high as 1000 grooves/mm are possible.  Experimental pattern sizes are up to 80 x 30 mm2, but could exceed 200 x 200 mm2.
There are three key challenges to produce high-performance e-beam written silicon immersion gratings  (1) E-beam field and subfield stitching boundaries cause periodic cross-hatch structures along the grating grooves.   The structures manifest themselves as spectral and spatial dimension ghosts in the diffraction limited point spread function (PSF) of the diffraction grating.  In this paper, we show that the effects of e-beam field boundaries must be mitigated.  We have significantly reduced ghost power with only minor increases in write time by using four or more reticles of less than 500 microns. (2) The finite e-beam stage drift and run-out error cause large-scale structure in the wavefront error.  We deal with this problem by applying a mark detection loop to check for and correct out minuscule stage drifts.  We measure the level and direction of stage drift and show that mark detection reduces peak-to-valley wavefront error by a factor of 5. (3) The serial write process for typical gratings yields write times of about 24 hoursÑthis makes prototyping costly.  We discuss work with negative e-beam resist to reduce the fill factor of exposure, and therefore limit the exposure time.
We also discuss the tradeoffs of long write-time serial write processes like e-beam with UV photomask lithography.  We show the results of experiments on small pattern size prototypes on Silicon wafers.  Current prototypes now exceed 30 dB of suppression on spectral and spatial dimension ghosts compared to monochromatic spectral purity measurements of the backside of Si echelle gratings in reflection at 632 nm.  We perform interferometry at 632 nm in reflection with a 25 mm circular beam, projected to 25 $\times$ 80 mm on the grating surface for a blaze angle of 71.6$^\circ$.  The measured wavefront error (tilt and focus removed) is 0.17 waves peak to valley.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

At the last SPIE meeting we described the detailed performance of the solitary immersion grating (part number CA-1 \cite{2012SPIE.8450E..2SG}) for the high resolution infrared spectrograph IGRINS \cite{2010SPIE.7735E..54Y}.  By the time of publication, IGRINS will have seen first light, with papers describing its performance appearing in the current volume.  The technical readiness of the immersion grating now rests on firm footing, and our group has now moved on to pushing the performance and design limitations of silicon optics.  The key limitation

CA-1 and all our heritage gratings and grisms were made with contact print
